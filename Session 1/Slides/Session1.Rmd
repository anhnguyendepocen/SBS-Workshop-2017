#  `R` and UoA's Department of Statistics

- `R` was initially written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka  *R & R* of the **\textcolor{blue}{Department of Statistics, University of Auckland}**.
- Three members of the *R Development Core Team* are in UoA's Department of Statistics.

# `R` and UoA's Department of Statistics
\begin{block}{What does this mean?}
  \textit{If you want to learn \texttt{R}, you are talking to the right people!}
\end{block}

# What is 'R`?
\begin{block}{What does this mean?}
  \texttt{R} is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics''
\end{block}
 
Key words:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FREE!
  \item Statistical computing
  \item Graphics (much more flexible than SAS, SPSS, JMP, etc.)
  \item Support from communities of different fields, i.e. \texttt{R} packages. \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/} and Bioconductor \url{https://www.bioconductor.org/}.
  \item Even Microsoft is in it: Microsoft R Open. \url{https://mran.microsoft.com/open/}.
\end{itemize}

# What is 'R`?
\begin{block}{What does this mean?}
  \texttt{R} is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics''
\end{block}


\texttt{R} and the biological sciences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many \textcolor{blue}{\emph{applications of statistical methods to biological datasets are 
  implemented in \texttt{R}}} 
  \item These \texttt{R} \emph{packages} are publically available on the web for immediate download and use.
  \item E.g. Next Generation Sequencing, Genomics (\texttt{Bioconductor}).
\end{itemize}



#How to download and install \texttt{R}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)
  \url{cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz}.
\item Download the relevant version for Linux/Mac/Windows.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We will only look at \texttt{R} in the Windows environment today.
  \end{itemize}
\item Install it on your computer (for Windows only):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Choose ``Yes (customized startup)'' in Startup options.
  \item Choose ``SDI (separate windows)'' in Display mode.
  \item Choose ``HTML help'' in Help .
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


#Using the \texttt{R} editor
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \texttt{R} GUI is not menu driven.
  \item Commands can be typed at the console.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item OK for simple calculations requiring few lines of code
    \item Painful for anything more!
  \end{itemize}
  \item We \emph{strongly} recommend using an \texttt{R} editor
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Great for reproducible analyses and research.
    \item Best editor for you depends on whether you are a(n)...
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Beginner: Built-in \texttt{R} editor,
      \item Advanced user: \texttt{R}studio, Tinn-R, Notepad++, and many others.
      \item \texttt{R} geek: Emacs
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

# Rstudio
- Helps in write better R code.
- Produce reports (Rmarkdown).
- Produce interactive reports/tools (Shiny).
- Develope R packages.

# Using \texttt{R} as a calculator

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1+2

1 + 3^2

log(15) - sqrt(3.4)

pnorm(1.96)
```

# Variable assignment

- `<-` is the "assign to" operator, made up of `<` and `-` without a space.
- E.g., `x <- 2` is read as "The value 2 is assigned to the object `x`".

```{r, echo = TRUE}  
x <- 2
y <- 3
x^2 - 3*y + 5
```

- `<-` has a direction, from right to left, `x <- 2` means assigning 2 to `x`,

# Variable assignment

- `->` operates from left to right, assigning `x` to 2.
    + 2 is a real value so you can not do that.

```{r, error=TRUE, echo = TRUE, size=10}
x -> 2
```

- `=` has no direction and can be confusing sometimes.
- It is good programming practice to use `<-`.
- The most important thing is to keep consistent. 


# Getting help
\begin{itemize}
\item Google!!!!\\
  e.g. How to calculate the mean in \texttt{R}? The
  search results
  tell you that the function \texttt{mean()} would be helpful.
\item Quick-R: \url{http://www.statmethods.net/}
\item R-bloggers: \url{https://www.r-bloggers.com/}
\end{itemize}


# Getting help
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{?} \\
  e.g. \texttt{?mean} brings up the help file for this function. It will tell
    you (almost) everything you need to know to use \texttt{mean()}.
   \item \texttt{??} \\
   e.g. \texttt{??mean} searches for everything related to mean in your computer.
   \item \texttt{RSiteSearch(" ")}\\
    Searches everything on CRAN as well as your computer.
\end{itemize}


# Data, files, statisticians and \texttt{R}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Statisticians prefer (read: \textbf{\emph{want}}) rectangular data files
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each case in its own row
    \item Data collected on each variable in its own column
    \item Variable names in the first row of each column
    \item No blanks, e.g. fill with NA, *, 99999, anything but a blank!
  \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{R} likes (read: \textbf{\emph{needs}}) this too!
  \item \texttt{R} prefers to read data files in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.
  \item This does not mean \texttt{R} only reads files stored in csv format.
\end{itemize}

# Getting data into \texttt{R}
Try your best to save your data in a \texttt{csv} or \texttt{txt} format.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most datasets are saved in an Excel spreadsheet.
  \item Do as much data cleaning as you can in Excel. No comments,
    no formatting, no colours, no fancy fonts.
  \item Convert it into \texttt{csv} by clicking on \texttt{Save
      As}. Change the \texttt{Save as type} from \texttt{xlsx} or \texttt{xls} into \texttt{CSV (Comma Delimited)}.
  \item \texttt{CSV} can have one worksheet only. If you have
    multiple worksheets, it saves the active worksheet.
\end{itemize}



# Read and Check

- Always set a working directory using `setwd()`, this can be a directory where you store the data and/or outputing the results.  
- Use \texttt{read.csv} to read a CSV file into \texttt{R}.
- \texttt{dim()}: Returns the number of observations (rows) and variables (columns).
- \texttt{head()}/\texttt{tail()}: Returns the first/last few rows of a data set.
- \texttt{str()}: Returns the structure of the dataset, e.g., dimension, column names, type of data object, first few values of each variable.
- \texttt{names()}: Returns the names of the variables contained in a dataset.


# \texttt{Growth.df}
Five variables:

- `CO2`: current or double (the current) CO~2~ level.
- `Species`: *Psidium guajava* (PG), *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana* (AC) and *Scheffera actinophylla* (SA).
- `root`: root biomass
- `shoot`: shoot biomass
- `biomass`: total biomass


# Reading data into \texttt{R}
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
setwd("your working directory")
Growth.df <- read.csv("Growth.csv")
head(Growth.df)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
Growth.df <- read.csv("..\\..\\data\\Growth.csv")
head(Growth.df)
```

# \texttt{dim()} and \texttt{str()}
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dim(Growth.df)
str(Growth.df)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
dim(Growth.df)
str(Growth.df)
```

# \texttt{names(Growth.df)}

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#Names of the variables
names(Growth.df)
```

- Anything following the \texttt{\#} symbol is treated as a comment and ignored by \texttt{R}.
- Writing comments is a very good habit to develop!


# Descriptive statistics
Calculate the mean of \texttt{biomass}:

```{r, error=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean(biomass)
```

You must tell \texttt{R} that \texttt{biomass} is a variable (column) *within* \texttt{Growth.df}, i.e.
```{r, error=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean(Growth.df$biomass)
```
You must also tell \texttt{R} how to deal with missing values: remove them before calculating the mean, i.e.
```{r, error=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
mean(Growth.df$biomass, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# \texttt{table} of counts
```{r}
# One-way table of counts

table(Growth.df$Species)
```

# \texttt{table} of proportions

```{r}
# Total count
total <- sum(table(Growth.df$Species))
total

# Proportions of total
table(Growth.df$Species)/total
```

# One-way tables \texttt{with} less typing
Tired of typing \texttt{Growth.df\$} over and over again? Use the \texttt{with} function.
```{r}
Species.table <- with(Growth.df, table(Species))
Species.table
total <- sum(Species.table)
Species.table/total
```


# One-way tables \texttt{with} less typing

```{r}
#Convert to percentages
Species.pct <- 100*Species.table/total
Species.pct
# Round to 1 decimal place
round(Species.pct, 1)
```

#  Two-way frequency tables
```{r}
Species.CO2.tab <- with(Growth.df, table(Species, CO2))
Species.CO2.tab
```

#  Two-way frequency tables
```{r}
# Calculate proportion with respect to 'margin' total
# margin = 1 (row total) or 2 (column total) 
perc.Species.CO2 <- prop.table(Species.CO2.tab, margin=2)
perc.Species.CO2
```

# Two-way frequency tables
```{r}
# Tabulate as percentages
round(100*perc.Species.CO2, 1)
```
