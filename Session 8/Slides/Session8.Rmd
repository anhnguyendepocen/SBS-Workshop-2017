# What if the response variable is \emph{not} continuous?
So far, we have considered methods for analysing response variables
measured on a continuous scale.
Often, measurements are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Counts} per unit time, e.g. number of hours worked in a working week.
  \item \emph{Binary} responses, e.g. Gender.
  \item \emph{Generalised} linear models: \emph{Poisson} (counts) and \emph{Logistic} (binary) regression
  \item \emph{Today} logistic regression \emph{only}
\end{itemize}


# Logistic regression

- Relates a \textcolor{blue}{\emph{binary}} \emph{response variable}
to a continuous and/or categorical variable.

- Let's illustrate by example using \texttt{combine.df}.
    + Does smoking habit depend on cholesterol level, height or weight?
    + Does the probability of smoking increase with age?
    + What characteristics do smoking patients have, i.e. how do smoking patients different from non smoking patients?

Speaking in statistical language, we have a binary response. A patient is either smoking or non-smoking, there is only two possible outcomes.

Logistic regression is typically used in case control studies. In this case, we can treat smoking as case and non-smoking as control.

# Logistic regression
\begin{center}
\textbf{Question}  

Is \texttt{Age} a useful indicator of people choosing to \texttt{smoke}?  

\textbf{How do we answer this?}   

By relating the \emph{probability} of \texttt{smoking} to \texttt{Age}.
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear regression is \emph{not} suitable here because:
\begin{itemize}
\item It assumes the response variable takes values from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.\\
\item But here takes only two values, namely \texttt{smoking} or \texttt{non-smoking}!
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


# Relating a probability to an explanatory variable

Let:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $p = \Pr\left(\mathtt{smoking} \right)$
  \item $1-p = \Pr\left(\mathtt{non-smoking} \right)$
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Definition:} The \emph{odds} that a respondent \texttt{smokes} is
\[ \text{odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}. \]
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{odds} of an event (i.e.  $\mathtt{smoking}$) tells us how likely that event is to occur relative to it not occurring.
\item To relate $p$ to an explanatory variable, we need the \textbf{\emph{log-odds}}, i.e.
\end{itemize}
\[ \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \mathtt{Intercept} + \mathtt{Slope} \times \mathtt{Age}. \]
\begin{itemize}
\item $\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$ is known as the \emph{logit} transformation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

# GLMs in \texttt{R}: \texttt{glm()}

\texttt{glm(formula, family, ...)}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{formula:} Similar format as \texttt{lm()}; response variable and explanatory variable(s) separated by "\~".
\item \texttt{family:} Use \texttt{family = binomial} for logistic regression.
\item \texttt{...} See the help file of \texttt{glm} (\texttt{?glm}) for other arguments.
\end{itemize}


# Logistic regression: Example
Suppose we want to find out whether older people are more likely to *smoke*.

Statistically speaking, we want to test whether the probability of \texttt{smoking} increases/decreases/does not change with \texttt{Age}.



#  Logistic regression: Example
\begin{itemize}
  \item Declare the response variable \texttt{Smoke.group} as a integer/numeric.
  \item \texttt{Yes} is assigned the numeric value 1 and
        \texttt{No} is assigned numeric value 0.
  \item It follows, therefore, that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $p=\Pr(\mathtt{smoke})$
    \item $p/(1-p)$ is the odds of participants "smoke" relative to "non-smoke".
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Note: Here, the explanatory variable Age is integer/numeric.



# GLMs in \texttt{R}: \texttt{glm()}
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
# class of Smoke.group?
class(combined.df$Smoke.group)

# Convert Smoke.group to a variable of type 'numeric'
# Assigned to a new variable Smoke.group1 
combined.df$Smoke.group1 <- 
  ifelse(combined.df$Smoke.group == "Yes", 1, 0)

# Numeric values of Smoke.group1?
class(combined.df$Smoke.group1)
```


# Logistic regression: Example 
Fit the model with \texttt{glm()}
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm <- with(combined.df, 
        glm(Smoke.group1~Age,family = binomial))
```
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{family = binomial}, logistic regression.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)
```

# Logistic regression: Example 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)
```


# Logistic regression: Example}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(try.glm)$coef
```

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{logit}(\text{smoke}) & = & `r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` + `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}.\\
\text{Odds}(\text{smoke}) & = & e^{`r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` + `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}\\
\text{Probability}(\text{smoke}) & = & \frac{e^{`r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` + `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}}{1 + e^{ `r round(coef(try.glm)[1], 2)` + `r round(coef(try.glm)[2], 2)` \times \text{Age}}}
\end{eqnarray*}


# Prediction from the model
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
# Logit scale, usually referred to as the
# 'linear predictor' scale
lp <- predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70))
lp

# Calculate the odds
exp(lp)
```
Interpretation: A 70-year old is \textbf{`r round(exp(lp),1)` times} likely to consider *smoke* than *not smoke*. Or, a 70-year old is \textbf{`r round(1/exp(lp),1)` times more} likely to *not smoke* than *smoke*.


# Prediction from the model
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
#Probability scale
predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70), type = "response")
```
Interpretation: The probability that a 70-year old *smokes* is `r predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 70), type = "response")`.


# Putting prediction into context
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
#Probability with standard error
predict(try.glm, data.frame(Age = 50),
type = "response", se.fit = TRUE)
```


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm2 <- with(combined.df, 
   glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.group, family = binomial))
anova(try.glm2, test = "Chisq")
```

Analysis of deviance table for a \texttt{glm()} object (generated using \texttt{anova()}) is analogous to ANOVA table for an \texttt{lm()} object.

```{r, echo = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm2 <- with(combined.df, 
   glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.group, family = binomial))
```

# Categorical explanatory variables

```{r}
anova(try.glm2, test = "Chisq")
```

# Categorical explanatory variables

```{r}
data.frame(anova(try.glm2, test = "Chisq"))
```

We have extremely strong evidence that at least one age group has different log-odds of choosing to "smoke" from the other age groups.


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r}
summary(try.glm2)
```

# Categorical explanatory variables

```{r, size = "footnotesize"}
summary(try.glm2)$coef
```

- \texttt{(Intercept)} corresponds to the reference age group, namely "Under 35" which is the one that is *not* listed!
- So, all subsequent rows of this table are hypothesis tests of the log-odds of the named age group relative to the reference group being  zero, i.e.


# Categorical explanatory variables
```{r, size = "footnotesize"}
summary(try.glm2)$coef
```
+ There is extremely strong evidence ($p$-value $<$ 0.0001) that the log-odds of choosing to *smoke* for the "Over 61" age group is higher than "Under 35".
+ There is extremely strong evidence ($p$-value $<$ 0.0001) that the log-odds of choosing *smoke* for "36 to 60" is different from "Under 35".
    
# Compare "Over 61" with "36 to 60"

- Create another factor for age group with different reference level.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
Age.refac <- factor(as.character(combined.df$Age.group),
   levels = c("Over 61", "36 to 60", "Under 35"))
```

- Re-fit the model.
```{r, tidy = FALSE}
try.glm3 <- glm(Smoke.group1 ~ Age.refac,
                family = binomial,
                data = combined.df)
```


# Compare "Over 61" with "36 to 60"
```{r, tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
summary(try.glm3)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(try.glm3)$coef
```
There is extremely strong evidence that the log-odds of choosing *smoke* for the "36 to 60" age group is *lower* than the ``Over 61'' age group.

# Code 

Insert a chunk of R code with 

\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{comment.png}

When you compile, R markdown will run the code and include its results. 


# inline code

Place code in a sentence with `` `r '\x60r #code\x60'` ``. R markdown will replace the code with its results. 

## Input:
Today is `` `r '\x60r Sys.Date()\x60'` ``

## Output
Today is `r Sys.Date()`


# Chuck options 

By default, R markdown includes both the code and its results

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.1\textwidth]{first.png}

## Output
```{r}
dim(iris)
```


# `echo`

Add `echo = FALSE` to hide the code. 

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{echo.png}

## Output
```{r, echo = FALSE}
dim(iris)
```


# `eval`

Add `eval = FALSE` to prevent the code to run.

## Input:
\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{eval.png}

## Output
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dim(iris)
```


# `fig.height`, `fig.width`

To specify the dimension of plots (in inches) with `fig.height` and `fig.width`. 


## Input:

\includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth]{fig.png}


# `fig.height`, `fig.width`

## Output
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 5}
hist(iris$Sepal.Width)
```


# `kable()`

`kable()` in `knitr` R package allows you to present tables.  

Note the option `results='asis'`, which will pass through results without reformatting them. 

## Input:

\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{kable.png}


# `kable()`

`kable()` in `knitr` R package allows you to present tables.   

Note the option `results='asis'`, which will pass through results without reformatting them. 

## Output:
```{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(iris))
```


# `Knitr` R package 

Three important points: 

- The *working directory* is the where the document is placed.   
- For each document, Knitr compile the R code as a new R session. Thus, you need to load the required libraries for *that document*.   
-  Any object made in one code chunk will be available to code in the later code chunk.
