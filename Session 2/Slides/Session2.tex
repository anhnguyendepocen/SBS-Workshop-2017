  \frametitle{Functions}
  A function is a relationship between a set of inputs (arguments)
    and a set of outputs. E.g., the function is fed some information on which it
    operates, the results of which are the output.

\end{figure}

This is an essential building block for the R package.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Functions}
\vspace{10pt}
  We have seen many functions, e.g. \texttt{log},
    \texttt{mean}, \texttt{table}, \texttt{with}, etc.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Working with functions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Functions can be user-defined, i.e., you can write your own.
   \item Output is the last line of the function. You can use \texttt{return()} to specifiy the output.
   \item Here is a function calculates the standard error of the mean (SEM).
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A set of user-defined functions can be bundled together into an R \texttt{package}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Getting data into \texttt{R}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Base \texttt{R} includes only functions which read data sets saved in simple file formats, e.g. \texttt{csv}, \texttt{txt}, tab delimited, etc.
  \item What if your data was saved in another format, e.g. STATA, SPSS, or SAS spreadsheets? 
  \item The \texttt{haven} package for \texttt{R} contains functions that may help!
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/index.html}
\end{itemize}
%\begin{alltt}
\begin{verbatim}
> library(haven)
> stata <- read_dta("data.dta")
> spss <- read_sav("data.sav")
> sas <- read_sas("data.sas7bdat")
> sasxport <- read_xpt("data.xpt")
\end{verbatim}
%\end{alltt}
However, it is always the easiest and safest to read data into \texttt{R} from a \texttt{csv} file.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Packages}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Currently, the CRAN package repository features 10,098 available
    packages (17 Feb. 2017). There are about 12,383 CRAN, BioConductor and Github packages in total.
  \item To install packages from the \texttt{R} GUI, click on
    \texttt{Packages} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Install Package(s) ...}
    $\rightarrow$ \texttt{New Zealand (or whatever region you are
    located)} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Package name}
  \item Or, you can type \texttt{install.packages("\textit{package name}")}, e.g. \texttt{install.packages("haven")}. 
  \item After the installation, use  \texttt{library(\textit{package name})}
        to load it into \texttt{R}. Note: Installation is performed only once; however,
        it must be loaded (i.e. use the command \texttt{library(\textit{package name})})
        in \emph{every} \texttt{R} session.
